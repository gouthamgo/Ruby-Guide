# Ruby Cheatsheet 


## Basics of Ruby 

- In Ruby, a variable is a place to store values of almost any type including Integer, Boolean, String, Array, and Hashes.
```
var = 92
```
**When doing arithmetic with two integers in Ruby, the result will always be an integer.**
```
12/3
                ==> Both give the same answer
12/3.0
```

## Number Types Conversion

```
# To convert an integer to a float:
18.to_f   #=> 18.0

# To convert a float to an integer:
12.0.to_i #=> 12
11.9.to_i #=> 11
```
